# Repertuar App

Demo: (rep.buterplayground.fun/)[https://rep.buterplayground.fun/]
Simple app i made using React for frontend and node.js for backend server to learn node.js and train React.

**I know that it doesn't look the best but i wanted to save some time on css in order to finish it faster and focus on another project to train node.js**

Database of my choice was MySql because it's the only one i know.
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Butterski/film-repertuar-app
```

Go to the project directory

Open two terminals 

In first one to start the app type:

```bash
  cd film-repertuar-app
```

```bash
  cd client
```
```bash
  npm install
```
```bash
  npm start
```

In the second to start the server:

```bash
  cd film-repertuar-app
```
```bash
  npm install
```
```bash
  npm start
```

#### MySql
Also you need MySql server, you can find example in this repo just import it into your MySql server :)


#### Docker
Maybe someday i will put this whole app into docker :D
